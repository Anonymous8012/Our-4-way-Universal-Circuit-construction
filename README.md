# Our 4-way Universal Circuit construction
This is a program of our 4-way UC construction. 
SizeofEUG_2(n).cpp is the c++ code for calculating the size of $EUG_2(n)$ for a given $n$;
ConstructionofEUG_1(n).cpp is the c++ code to construct a $EUG_1(n)$ for a given $n$, and the size of this $EUG_1(n)$ is the same of the one we caculate in SizeofEUG_2(n).cpp for $n=(4^k-4)/3$, $k$ is an integer. For other $n$, the size of this $EUG_1(n)$ may be a little more than that we have calculted;
The completed version of constructing $EUG_1(n)$ will be published later.
